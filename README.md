## Using the library
In order to use this library with VL you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/libraries/dependencies.html#manage-nugets) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.IO.OSC -pre

Once the VL.IO.OSC nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document you'll see the category "OSC" under "IO" in the nodebrowser. 

Demos are available via the Help Browser!
